OWASP Application Security Verification - Mandatory for the mesh architecture components and API security
Penetration Testing Certification - Required comprehensive testing focusing on:

API security
Authentication mechanisms
Device Passport infrastructure
Mesh Control Protocol security


Data Encryption Validation - Verification of the encryption implementation for data-at-rest and data-in-transit
Zero Trust Architecture Verification - Certification of the proper implementation of zero trust principles

Compliance Requirements

GDPR Compliance Certification - Mandatory for processing user data and maintaining user semantic profiles
ISO 27001 Certification - Required for information security management system validation
Device Authentication Security Verification - Specific to the Device Passport Database implementation
Distributed System Security Assessment - Required for the mesh architecture to validate secure node communication

Organizational Requirements

Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) - Mandatory assessment of data processing risks
Third-Party Access Security Assessment - Required for integration with external enterprise systems
Security Operations Readiness Certification - Validation of operational security procedures

The ME.AI architecture emphasizes security-by-design principles and includes a comprehensive Security & Compliance Database component, which will need to be properly certified before deployment.
