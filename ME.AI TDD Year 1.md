## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the proposed technical stack and architecture for Year 1 of the ME.AI platform. It focuses on the foundational Core Platform and the initial Agentic Product, IT Support, as defined by the MVP scope and feasibility analysis. The architecture aims to be robust, scalable, and provide a solid base for future enhancements while delivering tangible business value within the first year.

### 1.2 Year 1 Scope Summary

Based on the feasibility analysis of the "ME.ai_FDD_Impl Strategy & Business Value.md" document, the Year 1 scope will prioritize:

*   **Core Platform:** Establishing stable foundational capabilities for conversation processing, memory management, UI interaction, and inter-service communication. This includes features planned up to Release 2, with a focus on robustness and scalability. Advanced mesh concepts and AI features (like full semantic negotiation and dynamic coalition formation) will be initiated but with a more constrained scope, aiming for specific use-case support rather than generalized capabilities in Year 1.
*   **IT Support Product:** Delivering high-value IT automation for password resets, account unlocks, basic software installation, network issue diagnosis, and device diagnostics. The product features will align closely with the realistically achievable Core Platform capabilities within Year 1.

The emphasis is on delivering a functional, reliable, and valuable system in Year 1, deferring some of the most complex R&D-heavy features for more thorough development and stabilization in Year 2.

## 2. Guiding Architectural Principles for Year 1

*   **Modularity and Decoupling:** Design components with clear interfaces to allow for independent development, testing, and scaling.
*   **Iterative Development:** Build a strong foundation and incrementally add complexity and features.
*   **Pragmatism over Premature Complexity:** For Year 1, favor proven technologies and simpler architectural patterns where they meet requirements, especially for advanced mesh and AI concepts. Build towards the full vision iteratively.
*   **Scalability:** Design for horizontal scalability from the outset, particularly for stateless services.
*   **Security by Design:** Integrate security considerations into every layer of the architecture.
*   **Observability:** Implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing to ensure system health and facilitate troubleshooting.
*   **API-First:** Define clear APIs for inter-service communication and potential external integrations.

### 3.2 Key Core Platform Components (Year 1 Focus)

#### 3.2.1 UI Agentic Layer (Year 1)
*   **UI Agent Framework (Simplified):** Focus on modular, reusable UI components for chat interfaces. True agent autonomy will be deferred. Emphasis on responsive design for web and mobile.
*   **UI Personalization (Basic):** Store and retrieve basic user preferences (e.g., language, theme). Adaptive UI elements based on simple rules or explicit settings.
*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Primarily text-based chat. Basic Speech-to-Text (STT) for voice input can be integrated via cloud services if prioritized, with text being the primary internal processing format.

#### 3.2.2 Neural Core (Year 1)
*   **Conversation Processing Engine:**
    *   **NLU Service:** Intent recognition, entity extraction, sentiment analysis (basic). Utilize pre-trained models (e.g., from Hugging Face Transformers) fine-tuned on IT support data.
    *   **Dialogue Management:** State-based or simple rule-based dialogue flow for guided conversations, especially for IT support workflows.
    *   **NLG Service:** Template-based and simple generative responses. More advanced NLG for empathetic responses will be iterative.
*   **Memory Management:**
    *   **Session Memory:** Store conversation history and context for the current interaction (e.g., in Redis).
    *   **User Profile Store:** Persist user preferences, basic identity information, and links to semantic profiles.
    *   **Short-Term Semantic Cache:** Cache relevant semantic vectors or knowledge graph snippets for active conversations.
*   **Workflow Engine (Orchestration):**
    *   A centralized or service-oriented workflow engine (e.g., using Python libraries like Camunda Zeebe client, Prefect, or a simpler state machine implementation) to manage IT support processes.
    *   Define workflows for password reset, account unlock, etc.
    *   Integrate with external systems (ITSM, AD) via APIs.
*   **Semantic Engine (User/Org Basics):**
    *   **User Semantic Profile (Basic):** Store vector embeddings of user utterances or key concepts to begin building a semantic understanding. Focus on IT-related terminology familiarity.
    *   **Organizational Knowledge (Basic):** Ingest and index IT support knowledge base articles into a vector database and a basic knowledge graph for retrieval and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) patterns.

#### 3.2.3 Mesh Control Protocol (Simplified - Year 1)
*   **Service Discovery:** Leverage Kubernetes DNS for internal service discovery.
*   **API Gateway:** A central entry point for UI clients and potentially external services (e.g., Kong, Spring Cloud Gateway, or cloud provider's native API Gateway).
*   **Asynchronous Communication Bus:** Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, or cloud provider's native service) for decoupling services and handling asynchronous tasks (e.g., long-running workflow steps, notifications).
*   **Basic State Synchronization:** For critical shared state that cannot be fully managed by individual services or databases, explore solutions like etcd or Consul, but aim to minimize distributed state complexity in Year 1.
*   **No full P2P or dynamic coalition formation protocol in Year 1.** Focus on robust service-oriented communication.

## 6. Deployment Architecture (Year 1)

*   **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Recommended on a major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) to leverage managed services (Kubernetes, Databases, Messaging Queues, API Gateway).
*   **Containerization:** All services will be containerized using Docker.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes will be used for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.
*   **Environments:** Separate environments for Development, Staging/QA, and Production.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
*   **Scalability:** Stateless services will be designed to scale horizontally. Stateful services and databases will leverage cloud provider scalability features.

## 7. Security Architecture (Year 1)

*   **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect for user authentication. Consider using an identity provider like Keycloak or cloud provider's IAM.
*   **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for APIs and data access. Potentially Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for more granular needs later.
*   **Transport Security:** HTTPS/TLS for all external communication. mTLS for inter-service communication within the Kubernetes cluster (can be facilitated by a service mesh like Istio/Linkerd, or implemented at the application/gateway level initially).
*   **Data Security:**
    *   Encryption at rest for all sensitive data in databases (using managed database encryption features).
    *   Encryption in transit for data moving between services and to/from databases.
    *   Secrets management using tools like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider's secret manager.
*   **API Security:** Input validation, rate limiting, and authentication/authorization at the API Gateway and service levels.
*   **Device Passport Security:** This is critical. Device identity must be strongly verified. Communication with devices for diagnostics or operations must be over secure channels, and actions must be strictly permissioned and audited.
*   **Logging and Auditing:** Comprehensive audit trails for all sensitive operations, especially those involving PII, device access, or system changes.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Regular security scanning of code, containers, and infrastructure.
*   **Compliance:** Design with relevant compliance standards in mind from the start (e.g., GDPR, CCPA if applicable). Data residency considerations if required.

This document provides a foundational technical architecture for Year 1. It will evolve as the platform matures and new requirements emerge. Continuous review and refinement will be essential.
